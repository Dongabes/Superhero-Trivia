  <h2>What makes a Superhero?</h2>
  <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to be a superhero,<strong> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</strong>and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
  For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy fighting a bad guy could just be a regular police story or detective story or human interest story. But if it's a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
